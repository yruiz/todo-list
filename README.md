# A todo list

A Todolist I created following a tutotial from Python Engineer on YouTube.
I added a few modifications like not being able to add an empty todo entry, and hope to coninue adding more.
The backend uses Flask, SQLite with SQLAlchemy, and Python. The front end uses HTML and the SemanticUI Componenet Framework.
